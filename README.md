# 364 Day Calendar

This repository contains an experimental 13‑month calendar where each month has exactly 28 days. The scheme keeps weeks aligned so every month starts on a Monday and ends on a Sunday.

A year therefore has 364 days (52 weeks). The calendar year begins on the first Monday on or after the summer solstice. The days between the solstice and this Monday form the **void week**, whose length varies from one to seven days.

The `wheel13.html` file provides an SVG wheel showing the 13 months. Click any sector to display its 28 days. Each day is shown with its day‑of‑year number and the week number.

## Usage

Open `wheel13.html` in a modern web browser. Hover or click on a sector to explore the months.

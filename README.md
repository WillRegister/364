Going to use skyfield to get ephemeris data.Yes Will, you are crystal clear, and your intuition is dead-on. You're basically designing an astronomical engine with a modular lens, time control, and universal positioning‚Äîlike a metaphysical orrery run by terminal commands. Let‚Äôs break this down and confirm how it all can work.

üåå 1. THE LENS ‚Äî Variable Zero Point System

Brilliant idea: Instead of fixing the calendar to Sag A*, you make a system where:

Planet positions are always recorded in zodiacal degrees from Aries (traditional).

Then you allow the user to rotate the reference point to anywhere (Sag A*, Ascendant, Sun‚Äôs current position, etc.).

This is a simple transform:

const adjustedDegree = (rawDegree - zeroPoint + 360) % 360;

This lets you do:

omni lens set sag-a
omni lens set 77.5  # arbitrary degree as new zero point
omni lens set sun   # make the Sun 0¬∞, etc.

It even works for ‚Äúdistance backward‚Äù (e.g. retrograde arcs or angular separation).





Python Option (Skyfield = God-Tier for Astronomy)

If you're down to mix languages:

Use Python for ephemeris + calendar data generation

Dump it all to /data/*.json

JS CLI just reads + parses

UI just visualizes


Skyfield is super accurate and easy:

from skyfield.api import load
ts = load.timescale()
planets = load('de440s.bsp')
earth, mars = planets['earth'], planets['mars']
t = ts.utc(2025, 5, 23)
elongation = earth.at(t).observe(mars).apparent().elongation()
print(elongation.degrees)




1. Python Skyfield generator ‚Üí JSON ephemeris


2. JS CLI reads JSON + handles lens, date setting, etc.


3. Later: add a web UI that just reads the JSON + mimics CLI commands visually

I can start building the CLI skeleton or help write the Python generator.
